## Discrete Mathematics Basics

### Logic and Proofs

**Explanation:**

Logic is the foundation of reasoning in mathematics and computer science. It involves understanding statements, their truth values, and how they can be combined to form more complex expressions.

- **Propositions:** A proposition is a statement that is either **true** or **false** but not both.
  
  - *Example:* "It is raining." This is a proposition because it can be either true or false.

- **Logical Operators:**
  
  - **AND (`∧`):** True if both statements are true.
    
    - *Example:* "It is raining **and** it is cold." This is true only if both conditions are true.
  
  - **OR (`∨`):** True if at least one statement is true.
    
    - *Example:* "It is raining **or** it is sunny." This is true if either condition is true.
  
  - **NOT (`¬`):** Inverts the truth value.
    
    - *Example:* "It is **not** raining." If it's raining, this statement is false, and vice versa.
  
  - **IMPLICATION (`→`):** "If P then Q." This is false only when P is true and Q is false.
    
    - *Example:* "If it rains, then the ground is wet."

- **Truth Tables:** A truth table displays the truth values of logical expressions based on all possible truth values of their components.

**Example:**

Consider the logical expression: \( P \rightarrow Q \)

| P (It is raining) | Q (The ground is wet) | \( P \rightarrow Q \) |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| True              | True                  | True                  |
| True              | False                 | False                 |
| False             | True                  | True                  |
| False             | False                 | True                  |

**Exercises:**

1. **Determine Truth Values:**
   - Given \( P = \text{"It is sunny"} \) and \( Q = \text{"I will go for a walk"} \), evaluate the truth of the following statements:
     - \( P \land Q \)
     - \( P \lor Q \)
     - \( \neg P \)
     - \( P \rightarrow Q \)

2. **Construct a Truth Table:**
   - Create a truth table for the expression \( (P \lor Q) \land \neg R \).

3. **Logical Equivalence:**
   - Prove that \( P \rightarrow Q \) is equivalent to \( \neg P \lor Q \).

### Sets, Relations, and Functions

**Explanation:**

Understanding sets, relations, and functions is crucial for modeling and solving problems in computer science.

- **Sets:**
  
  - A set is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right.
  
  - **Notation:** \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) denotes a set \( A \) containing elements 1, 2, and 3.
  
  - **Operations:**
    
    - **Union (\( \cup \)):** Combines elements from both sets.
      
      - *Example:* \( A \cup B \) where \( A = \{1, 2\} \) and \( B = \{2, 3\} \) results in \( \{1, 2, 3\} \).
    
    - **Intersection (\( \cap \)):** Contains elements common to both sets.
      
      - *Example:* \( A \cap B \) results in \( \{2\} \).
    
    - **Difference (\( \setminus \)):** Elements in one set but not the other.
      
      - *Example:* \( A \setminus B \) results in \( \{1\} \).

- **Relations:**
  
  - A relation is a connection between elements of two sets.
  
  - **Example:** "is greater than" is a relation between numbers.
  
  - **Properties:**
    
    - **Reflexive:** Every element is related to itself.
    
    - **Symmetric:** If \( a \) is related to \( b \), then \( b \) is related to \( a \).
    
    - **Transitive:** If \( a \) is related to \( b \) and \( b \) is related to \( c \), then \( a \) is related to \( c \).

- **Functions:**
  
  - A function is a special type of relation where each element in the domain is related to exactly one element in the codomain.
  
  - **Notation:** \( f: A \rightarrow B \) denotes a function \( f \) from set \( A \) to set \( B \).
  
  - **Types of Functions:**
    
    - **One-to-One (Injective):** Each element of the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain.
    
    - **Onto (Surjective):** Every element in the codomain is mapped by at least one element from the domain.
    
    - **Bijective:** A function that is both injective and surjective.

**Example:**

- **Set Operations:**

  Let \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \).

  - \( A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \)
  - \( A \cap B = \{3\} \)
  - \( A \setminus B = \{1, 2\} \)

- **Function Example:**

  Define \( f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \) by \( f(x) = 2x \).

  - **Injective:** Yes, because each input maps to a unique output.
  - **Surjective:** No, because odd numbers in the codomain are not mapped by any element in the domain.
  
  Therefore, \( f \) is **not** bijective.

**Exercises:**

1. **Set Operations:**
   - Let \( C = \{a, b, c\} \) and \( D = \{b, c, d\} \). Compute:
     - \( C \cup D \)
     - \( C \cap D \)
     - \( C \setminus D \)
     - \( D \setminus C \)

2. **Relations:**
   - Define a relation \( R \) on set \( \{1, 2, 3\} \) such that \( R = \{(1,2), (2,3)\} \). Determine if \( R \) is reflexive, symmetric, and/or transitive.

3. **Functions:**
   - Define a function \( g: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \) by \( g(x) = x + 1 \).
     - Is \( g \) injective?
     - Is \( g \) surjective?
     - Is \( g \) bijective?

## Big O Notation and Complexity Analysis

### Time and Space Complexity

**Explanation:**

Understanding the efficiency of algorithms is critical, especially when dealing with large datasets. Time and space complexity help in evaluating how the runtime and memory usage of an algorithm scale with the size of the input.

- **Time Complexity:**
  
  - Represents the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size \( n \).
  
  - **Big O Notation:** Describes the upper bound of the time complexity, focusing on the worst-case scenario.
    
    - *Example:* An algorithm with \( O(n) \) time complexity scales linearly with the input size.

- **Space Complexity:**
  
  - Represents the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size \( n \).
  
  - **Big O Notation:** Similar to time complexity, it describes the upper bound of the memory usage.
    
    - *Example:* An algorithm with \( O(1) \) space complexity uses constant memory regardless of input size.

**Common Time Complexities:**

| Big O Notation | Description                                 | Example Algorithm               |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| \( O(1) \)     | Constant time                               | Accessing an array element       |
| \( O(\log n) \)| Logarithmic time                            | Binary search                    |
| \( O(n) \)     | Linear time                                 | Linear search                    |
| \( O(n \log n) \)| Linearithmic time                         | Merge sort, Quick sort           |
| \( O(n^2) \)   | Quadratic time                              | Bubble sort, Insertion sort      |
| \( O(2^n) \)   | Exponential time                            | Recursive Fibonacci calculation  |
| \( O(n!) \)    | Factorial time                              | Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via brute-force |

**Example:**

- **Linear Search:**

  In a linear search, you check each element of a list until you find the target or reach the end.

  ```java
  public class LinearSearch {
      public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
          for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
              if (arr[i] == target) {
                  return i;
              }
          }
          return -1; // Not found
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          int[] numbers = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
          int target = 8;
          int index = linearSearch(numbers, target);
          if(index != -1) {
              System.out.println("Element found at index: " + index);
          } else {
              System.out.println("Element not found.");
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \) because, in the worst case, you might have to check every element.

- **Binary Search:**

  Binary search efficiently finds an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

  ```java
  public class BinarySearch {
      public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
          int left = 0;
          int right = arr.length - 1;

          while(left <= right) {
              int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

              if(arr[mid] == target) {
                  return mid;
              } else if(arr[mid] < target) {
                  left = mid + 1;
              } else {
                  right = mid - 1;
              }
          }
          return -1; // Not found
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          int[] numbers = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
          int target = 8;
          int index = binarySearch(numbers, target);
          if(index != -1) {
              System.out.println("Element found at index: " + index);
          } else {
              System.out.println("Element not found.");
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  **Time Complexity:** \( O(\log n) \) because the search space is halved in each step.

**Exercises:**

1. **Determine Time Complexity:**
   - Analyze the time complexity of the following code snippet:
     ```java
     for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
         for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
             System.out.println(i + ", " + j);
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Answer:** \( O(n^2) \) because there are two nested loops, each running \( n \) times.

2. **Space Complexity Analysis:**
   - Determine the space complexity of a function that creates a new array of size \( n \) and copies all elements from an input array to this new array.

3. **Compare Algorithms:**
   - Given two algorithms with time complexities \( O(n \log n) \) and \( O(n^2) \), which one is more efficient for large values of \( n \)? Explain why.

---

### Best, Average, and Worst Case Analysis

**Explanation:**

Analyzing different cases of input scenarios helps in understanding the performance of an algorithm under various conditions.

- **Best Case:**
  
  - The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of steps.
  
  - *Example:* In linear search, the best case occurs when the target element is at the first position.

- **Average Case:**
  
  - Represents the expected performance over all possible inputs.
  
  - *Example:* In linear search, on average, the target element is found halfway through the array.

- **Worst Case:**
  
  - The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of steps.
  
  - *Example:* In linear search, the worst case occurs when the target element is at the last position or not present at all.

**Example:**

- **Insertion Sort:**

  - **Best Case:** The array is already sorted.
    - **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \) because it only needs to traverse the array once.
  
  - **Average Case:** The array elements are in random order.
    - **Time Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \)
  
  - **Worst Case:** The array is sorted in reverse order.
    - **Time Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \)

- **Binary Search:**

  - **Best Case:** The target element is at the middle position.
    - **Time Complexity:** \( O(1) \)
  
  - **Average Case:** The target element is somewhere in the array.
    - **Time Complexity:** \( O(\log n) \)
  
  - **Worst Case:** The target element is not present or at the end of the array.
    - **Time Complexity:** \( O(\log n) \)

**Exercises:**

1. **Identify Cases:**
   - For the Quick Sort algorithm, describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios in terms of input arrangement.

2. **Time Complexity Comparison:**
   - Given two sorting algorithms, one with best-case \( O(n) \) and worst-case \( O(n^2) \), and another with consistent \( O(n \log n) \) across all cases, discuss which one might be preferable in practice and why.

3. **Analyze Search Algorithms:**
   - Compare the best, average, and worst-case time complexities of Linear Search and Binary Search.

## Mathematical Proof Techniques

### Induction

**Explanation:**

Mathematical induction is a proof technique used to establish that a statement holds for all natural numbers. It consists of two main steps:

1. **Base Case:** Verify that the statement holds for the initial value (usually \( n = 1 \)).
2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for \( n = k \) (inductive hypothesis) and then prove it holds for \( n = k + 1 \).

**Example:**

**Prove:** The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

**Proof:**

1. **Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
   
   \( \text{Sum} = 1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1 \)  
   The base case holds.

2. **Inductive Step:**
   
   - **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for \( n = k \), i.e.,  
     \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \)
   
   - **Prove for \( n = k + 1 \):**  
     \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + k + (k + 1) = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2} \)
   
   - **Using the Inductive Hypothesis:**  
     \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k + 1) = \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k + 1)}{2} = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2} \)
   
   - Thus, the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \).

By mathematical induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers \( n \).

**Exercises:**

1. **Prove the Formula for the Sum of Squares:**
   
   Prove that \( 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \dots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \) using induction.

2. **Geometric Series:**
   
   Prove that the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series \( a + ar + ar^2 + \dots + ar^{n-1} \) is \( a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \) for \( r \neq 1 \).

3. **Algorithm Correctness:**
   
   Use induction to prove that the binary search algorithm correctly finds the target element in a sorted array.

---

### Contradiction

**Explanation:**

Proof by contradiction involves assuming the opposite of what you want to prove and showing that this assumption leads to a logical inconsistency or an impossible situation. This method is powerful for establishing the truth of statements indirectly.

**Example:**

**Prove:** There is no smallest positive rational number.

**Proof:**

1. **Assume the Contrary:** Suppose there exists a smallest positive rational number, say \( r \).
   
2. **Construct a Smaller Number:** Consider \( \frac{r}{2} \), which is also a positive rational number.
   
3. **Contradiction:** \( \frac{r}{2} \) is smaller than \( r \), which contradicts the assumption that \( r \) is the smallest positive rational number.
   
4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, our initial assumption is false. There is no smallest positive rational number.

**Exercises:**

1. **Irrationality of \( \sqrt{2} \):**
   
   Prove that \( \sqrt{2} \) is irrational using proof by contradiction.

2. **Infinite Primes:**
   
   Show that there are infinitely many prime numbers by assuming the opposite and reaching a contradiction.

3. **Non-existence of Integer Solutions:**
   
   Prove that the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 3z^2 \) has no non-trivial integer solutions using contradiction.

## Number Theory and Combinatorics

### Prime Numbers, GCD, LCM

**Explanation:**

Number theory deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, particularly integers. Understanding prime numbers, Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), and Least Common Multiple (LCM) is fundamental for various algorithms.

- **Prime Numbers:**
  
  - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
  
  - **Examples:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, …

- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
  
  - The largest integer that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder.
  
  - **Example:** GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.

- **Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
  
  - The smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.
  
  - **Example:** LCM of 4 and 6 is 12.

**Algorithms:**

- **Euclidean Algorithm for GCD:**

  ```java
  public class GCDExample {
      public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
          if(b == 0) {
              return a;
          }
          return gcd(b, a % b);
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          int a = 48;
          int b = 18;
          System.out.println("GCD of " + a + " and " + b + " is " + gcd(a, b));
      }
  }
  ```

  **Output:**
  ```
  GCD of 48 and 18 is 6
  ```

- **Calculating LCM:**

  Since \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \), we can use the GCD to find the LCM.

  ```java
  public class LCMExample {
      public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
          if(b == 0) {
              return a;
          }
          return gcd(b, a % b);
      }

      public static int lcm(int a, int b) {
          return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          int a = 4;
          int b = 6;
          System.out.println("LCM of " + a + " and " + b + " is " + lcm(a, b));
      }
  }
  ```

  **Output:**
  ```
  LCM of 4 and 6 is 12
  ```

**Exercises:**

1. **Prime Identification:**
   
   Write a program to check if a given number is prime.

2. **GCD and LCM:**
   
   - Compute the GCD and LCM of 56 and 98.
   - Verify that \( \text{GCD}(a, b) \times \text{LCM}(a, b) = a \times b \).

3. **Prime Factorization:**
   
   Implement an algorithm to perform prime factorization of a given number.

### Permutations and Combinations

**Explanation:**

Combinatorics deals with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. Permutations and combinations are fundamental concepts used in probability, statistics, and algorithm design.

- **Permutations:**
  
  - The arrangement of objects where the order matters.
  
  - **Formula:** \( P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!} \)
  
  - **Example:** The number of ways to arrange 3 books out of 5 is \( P(5, 3) = 60 \).

- **Combinations:**
  
  - The selection of objects where the order does not matter.
  
  - **Formula:** \( C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \)
  
  - **Example:** The number of ways to choose 3 students out of 5 is \( C(5, 3) = 10 \).

**Example:**

- **Permutations Example:**

  Calculate the number of 2-letter arrangements from the letters A, B, C.

  - \( P(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{(3 - 2)!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6 \)
  
  - Arrangements: AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CB

- **Combinations Example:**

  Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 letters from A, B, C.

  - \( C(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)
  
  - Combinations: AB, AC, BC

**Exercises:**

1. **Permutations Calculation:**
   
   - How many different 4-digit PIN codes can be formed using the digits 0-9 without repetition?

2. **Combinations Calculation:**
   
   - In how many ways can a committee of 3 be formed from a group of 10 people?

3. **Application in Algorithms:**
   
   - Given a string of length \( n \), how many unique permutations can be formed if all characters are distinct?

4. **Real-world Problem:**
   
   - A password requires 3 letters followed by 2 digits. How many possible passwords can be formed if letters and digits can be repeated?
